# SmartPlant Watering System

## Overview

This project includes the code for a "self-watering" plant system. It utilizes a moisture sensor to check the moisture level of the soil and a pump to automatically water the plant when the moisture level dips below a set level. It also publishes the moisture data and data from other local sensors to the Adafruit Cloud, where additional functions, like an online button to "manually water" can be accessed. 

## Details

This device will use the following components:

* Particle Argon Microcontroller
* PAGOW Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor
* SparkFun BME280
* ElectroPeak 0.96" OLED
* 
*
